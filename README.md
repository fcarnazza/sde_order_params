# sde_order_params
A way to learn the stochastic dynamics of order parameters for 
The 2d ising model and the 1d contact process (classical).
Please use the jupyter notebook inside each folder to learn the drift (from infinitesimal generator)
and diffusion (from quadratic variation)

DOI for contact process dataset is [10.5281/zenodo.11504229](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.11504228)
